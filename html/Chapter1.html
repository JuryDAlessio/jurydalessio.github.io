                                Before moving to the United Kingdom to pursue my university degree my relationship with
                                the English language has always been limited to what I did in school and
                                the content and information I consumed on the internet. This was not helped by the small reality in which I
                                lived before moving to the United Kingdom for my studies. The very small town that I lived in
                                the centre of the Italian peninsula has never been a spot where it was possible to meet
                                foreign people and therefore speak and understand the quirks of the English language.
                                <br><br>
                                The limitation of the Italian school system in regards to the study of languages has been exposed by a study on the role of English as a second language in Italy, made by the University of Ontario survey of English teachers in Italy in which “only a quarter of respondents (25.9%) agreed that public language education is effective and no one strongly agreed with this statement. Also only half (51.8%) of the respondents agreed that teaching methods used for English instruction at the primary and secondary levels are effective” (Farahnaz Faez, 2011 )
                                <br><br>
                                Because of that, the English that I learned to speak, read and understand has always been a mixture of different variants, some related to the people that speak English natively and some from cultures that, like me, had to learn it as a second language. 
                                <br><br>
                                The way I interacted and used the language in my day to day life had shaped the words and expressions that I learned and the meaning that I gave to them. Another important factor in the way I shaped the meaning of the expressions that I learned were the groups that I interacted with on the internet and therefore the people that shared my interests.
                                <br><br>
                                My background and my inclination for STEM disciplines also shaped my view of the world in a way that does not give too much importance to humans and how they relate to each other through mediums like language. My business related studies reinforced this perception by limiting the role of people as simple actors in an economic model or a company setting.
                                <br><br>
                                The obvious limitations of the method in which I learned English caused a lack of understanding of certain cultural aspects of the United Kingdom related to expressions specific to British English and the underlying meaning of them. My confusion was most visible in regard to phatic communication, with some expressions still causing me problems today. I decided to explore this topic to better analyse the functions of phatic communication, the interconnection between culture and phatic expressions and how these expressions evolved in the age of the internet.
                                <br><br>
                                While I was always unconsciously aware about the existence of phatic expressions, since there exist a fundamental number of expressions in Italian that are needed to comprehend other people even at a basic level to avoid possible misunderstanding that appear to have almost no sense in a setting if the context behind the use of the word is not understood especially in the setting in which I lived.
                                <br><br>
                                The phatic expression that I found most challenging and curious in British English is "You alright?" used by everyone has a greeting to break the silence, one of the 12 functions of phatic communication that are (1) breaking the silence, (2) starting a conversation, (3) making small  talk, (4) making gossip, (5) keeping talking, (6) expressing solidarity, (7) creating harmony, (8) creating comfort, (9) expressing empathy, (10) expressing friendship, (11) expressing respect, (12) expressing politeness (Jumanto 2014).<br>
                                The discrepancy between the phrase itself and the underlying meaning of it is pretty obvious when you are a native speaker, but before I learned what it actually meant I always wondered why everyone was wondering if I was alright and never interpreted it as just a greeting until I asked one of my housemates why everyone always uses this expression when meeting me.  “The specific knowledge about the conventions regarding the behaviour expected in conversational exchanges is the key for the correct understanding of conversations in which apparently no relevant information is transmitted”(Cruz, M. P. 2001). And my lack of the required specific knowledge caused the cross-cultural misunderstanding.
                                <br><br>
                                The most eye opening intercultural experience, the one that mostly made me aware of how limited my understanding of the language was, while seemingly simple, is the one in which one of my British housemates explained to me the meaning of "You alright?".
                                <br><br>
                                The specific conversation happened during my second year at University. After moving into the new house that I was renting with 5 of my friends it was not long since some sort of rituals started forming between us. One of these daily fixed appointments was to drink coffee at the kitchen table. One of these “situations” was characterised by me asking what the "You alright?" expression meant because I was very confused as to why people were asking me if I was ok and especially about what I was supposed to reply. My housemate promptly proceeded to answer my question, he explained that it was a simple way to say hi and that the only thing I had to reply was “You alright?”
                                <br><br>
                                After my housemate explained that to me my perception of the English language and how certain expressions relate to the culture of native speakers widened and I realised that there was much more for me to learn of the English language to properly understand the people around me in this new environment and that the learning would never stop since the more cultures I explored the more I had to learn. I also came to the understanding that some parts of a different culture can only be learned by experiencing it, since it is the only way to appreciate the interactions and expressions that people take for granted and don’t think are relevant enough to be explained in a school setting.
                                <br><br>
                                This encounter made me realise the way people interact with each other using language and specific expressions is way more complex and intricate than what I actually thought previously.  This realisation and my curiosity in better understanding this specific topic are the reasons behind me deciding to choose to talk about it in this portfolio. I think that learning more about phatic expressions is going to be a fun experience that will result in a deepened understanding not only of the subject but also of the people around me.
