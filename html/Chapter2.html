                                With the maturity of the web 2.0 in the last two decades there has been a rise in the creation of platforms that are seen as de facto sub cultures. The birth of these cultures has paved the way for the creation of new and unique forms of phatic communications that are exclusive to the internet and can be easily shaped to tailor to each of these smaller groups whose unity is generally based on specific common interests. The rapid growth of these new forms of communications have sparked the curiosity of older generations and the legacy forms of media. Memes are the most discussed of these new forms of communication thanks to the effectiveness that they have in conveying relatable messages.
                                <br><br>
                                The Oxford language dictionary defines memes as “an image, a video, a piece of text, etc. that is passed very quickly from one internet user to another, often with slight changes that make it humorous”. The first appearance of the word meme was in 1967 in Richard Dawkins book “The Selfish Gene” in which he defines the term as a “name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation.”(Dawkins, 1976) with the replicator being “the soup of human culture”(Dawkins, 1976). The term was subsequently “hijacked” to describe what we now think when we hear the word meme.
                                The first forms of memes as we know them can be traced back to 2008 and have since then been a fundamental part of online communication. <br>
                                The impact that memes had on the new generation is shown also in the amount of references that are done to memes by teenagers and young adults while interacting outside of the online space.
                                <br><br>
                                Memes have proved to be a form of communication capable of rapidly evolving and to quickly adapt to new online environments, different formats and even different types of media. This is thanks to the ability of memes to convey meanings that go beyond the appearance of the meme itself transmitting information in a phatic way. <br>
                                As a form of phatic communication, memes can be quite versatiles, they allow to achieve multiple of the functions described by Jumanto both with or without the aid of text but they particularly excel at starting a conversation, making small talk, making gossip, and creating comfort through the medium of laughter.
                                <br><br>
                                A perfect example of the efficacy of memes as a form of phatic communication both inside and outside of the internet is Pepe the frog, a character originally introduced in the “Boy's Club” comic that, thanks to its “modularity”, excelled as expressing empathy in different ways and in multiple angles of the internet, especially on the /r9k/ 4chan board and even outside of it after being used as a mascot by during the Hong Kong protests. The controversy attached to the figure of Pepe according to which “Pepe became a favourite icon of last-straw ranters spewing extreme misogyny, racism and vengefulness” (Nagle, 2016) fails to spot the actual versatility of Pepe as a form of communication and reduces it to a symbol.
                                <br><br>
                                The communicative power that memes have thanks to their immediate impact made possible the creation and the growth of communities either based around memes or using them to increase the sense of unity inside the community. Some of these communities have the aim of doing political activism through campaigns that are immediately recognised thanks to the use of memes. <br>
                                This is both a negative and positive aspect for those movements. Since memes can be easily recognisable and are easily associable they are a great way to leave an impression but are also symbols that are easily targetable by the people observing, possibly classifying them as people appertaining to that group. That is the case with groups with more extreme ideologies such as the “Boogaloo boys” which are easily demonised and described as “digital-native extremists”(Thomas, 2021) by the media because of their ironic online takes. 
                                <br><br>
                                The role and the efficacy of memes as a form of phatic communication has made possible for memes to first expand themselves outside of more niche sides of the internet to the more mainstream users and subsequently to transcend the internet and find their place in the day to day life of the younger generation. The influence that memes have as a form of communication has increased the generational gap between the younger generations that grew up in the years of the web2.0 and the older generations that grew up when the internet was not yet invented or was at its early stages of development. The widening of the generational gap has imposed a renegotiation of roles in the family where parents and children have new and different ways of communication.
                                <br><br>
                                The ease of transmission of memes has sparked the interest of businesses now exploring the use of relatable memes to tailor the communication of their ads to appeal to the younger generation of consumers and mostly failing due to the age gap between the people making the ads and the people to whom the ads are targeted to. This is due to the losing of the intrinsic meaning that memes have for the sake of selling a product. Particular example of this is the case of a failed Wendy’s commercial that sparked a negative reaction in which the users where “horrified by the commercial use of image board meme culture”(Granata 2019)
                                <br><br>
                                The efficacy and ease of use that memes have as a form of communication has quickly made them a tool used even by the people that were or are not in the communities that created and used memes before the social media boom. This has sparked a counter movement in the meme community with the aim to disrupt the understanding of memes to the general public with the use of more and more complex forms that sometimes reach the nonsensical. This is achieved through the use of multiple levels of irony and the disruption of the canonical role that memes had.
                                <br><br>
                                How multiple levels of irony are used as a form of internet expression is explained by youtuber and artist Greg Guevara, also known as Jreg in his video titled: “Post-Irony, Meta-Irony, and Post-Truth Satire”. In the video, irony is illustrated as having multiple layers.
                                The first is layer 0, in which the person speaking is sincere.<br>
                                The first is layer 1, where the words of the speaker are ironic and sarcastic.<br>
                                The first is layer 2, where Post-Irony and Meta-Irony become part of the picture.<br>
                                In the video Post-Irony is defined as “the return from sincerity to from irony”(Guevara, 2019) Meta-Irony is defined as a way to leave the receiver of the message in a state of confusion about the true intent of the sender, a Meta-Ironic expression exists “only in reference to itself”(Guevara,2019).
                                <br><br>
                                The employment of this twist on irony is both a consequence of  the staleness of memes and of the need for some communities and people to separate themselves from the masses that entered the new internet communities of the social media era and to provide a clear boundary of separation between them and the “Normies”. The implementation of Meta-Irony in meme communities is done through the use of Meta-memes. 
                                The term Metameme encapsulates this new idea of memes that meme themselves and the environment that they are created in, with the joke hidden under multiple levels of irony and not immediately understandable to everyone. This may seem counterintuitive at the beginning but the creation of increasingly ironic memes makes sense when what was once a form of subculture becomes increasingly open to more and more people discovering internet communities every day. The use of Meta-memes is a way of people to signal that they understand the joke while the joke is the existence of the joke in the meme that they are seeing.
                                <br><br>
                                The origin of this “counter movement” can be traced back to 2016 gaining traction and popularity in 2018 with the birth of “deep fried memes” this type of memes were characterised by their very high contrast images and by the nonsensical text that could be understood only by the people whose online presence was deeply radicated in those communities were the memes were created. It is therefore possible to notice that memes as a form of communication have been able to create different subcultures deeply entangled with memes as a concept and using memes to express themselves and relating to each other more than simply making a joke.
                                <br><br>
                                The increase in popularity of more “esoteric” forms of memes is also contributing to enlarging the generational gap between the people from the generation Z to the generations that came before them.
                                The consequences of this bigger generational gap are a lack of mutual understanding between generations 
                                <br><br>
                                The cultural impact that memes have in creating and expanding communities has also paved the way for the birth of a new kind of discrimination based on new stereotypes that are entirely based on the platform and the online communities that someone is a part of or that he is associated with. <br>
                                “A stereotype is a social prejudice. Its foundation is not factual, but emotional. The emotion in question may range from hatred to admiration” (Harris, 2009: 139). And this is perfectly shown in today's internet subcultures that tend to separate themselves based on their platform of choice even if the subculture that is defined by the interests is a common trait between them. A perfect example of this phenomenon is the hostility between people from Reddit and Instagram in the late 2010s in which people from the latter platform were seen as being thieves of memes not produced by them in order to grow their pages and gaining off the popularity that those stolen jokes brought with brand deals.
