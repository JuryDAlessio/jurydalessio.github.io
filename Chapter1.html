                                Before moving to the United Kingdom to pursue my university degree, my relationship with the English language was always  limited to what I learnt in school, and the content and information I consumed on the internet. This was not helped by the small reality in which I lived before moving to the United Kingdom for my studies; the very small town in the centre of the Italian peninsula has never been a spot where it was possible to meet foreign people and therefore speak and understand the quirks of the English language.
                                <br><br>
                                The Italian school system has been found to be limited in its capacity to teach foreign languages. A survey conducted by the University of Ontario exploring the sentiments of English teachers in Italy found that “only a quarter of respondents (25.9%) agreed that public language education is effective and no one strongly agreed with this statement. Also only half (51.8%) of the respondents agreed that teaching methods used for English instruction at the primary and secondary levels are effective” (Farahnaz Faez, 2011).Due to the inefficacy of ELT (English Language teaching) ,  the English that I learned to speak, read and understand has always been a mixture of different variants, some related to native English speakers and some from cultures that, like me, had to learn it as a second language. 
                                <br><br>
                                The way I interacted and used the language in my day to day life had shaped the words and expressions that I learned and the meaning that I gave to them. Another important factor in the way I shaped the meaning of the expressions that I learned were the groups, or communities of practice (Lave and Wenger, 1991), that I interacted with on the internet and therefore the people that shared my interests.In addition, my background and inclination for STEM disciplines also shaped my view of the world in a way that does not give too much importance to humans and how they relate to each other through mediums like language. My business related studies reinforced this perception by limiting the role of people as simple actors in an economic model or a company setting.
                                <br><br>
                                While I was always aware of the existence of phatic expressions in Italian, specifically those required to comprehend others at a basic level of communicative competence, I had not considered the implications and misunderstandings that could occur if the context behind these expressions, especially in a second language.The obvious limitations of the method in which I learned English caused a lack of understanding of certain cultural aspects of the United Kingdom, often specifically related to expressions  present in British English and their underlying meaning. My confusion was most visible in regard to phatic communication, with some expressions still causing me problems today. I decided to explore this topic to better analyse the functions of phatic communication, the interconnection between culture and phatic expressions and how these expressions evolved in the age of the internet.
                                <br><br>
                                Phatic communication is understood to offer 12 possible functions: creating harmony, (8) creating comfort, (9) expressing empathy, (10) expressing friendship, (11) expressing respect, (12) expressing politeness (Jumanto, 2014). These functions, if not already understood, can cause confusion, for example the phatic expression I found both challenging and curious in British English is "you alright?". <br>
                                The discrepancy between the phrase itself and the underlying meaning of it is arguably obvious when you are a native speaker, however, before I learned what it actually meant I always wondered why everyone was asking if I was alright; I never interpreted it as just a greeting until I asked one of my housemates why everyone always uses this expression when meeting me. Cruz (2001) explains my lack of understanding of such a phrase as “The specific knowledge about the conventions regarding the behaviour expected in conversational exchanges is the key for the correct understanding of conversations in which apparently no relevant information is transmitted” - in this scenario I did not have the specific knowledge and so cross-cultural misunderstanding ensued.
                                <br><br>
                                My first encounter of  this specific conversation happened during my second year at University. After moving out of halls and into a house with five of my friends, we started forming daily rituals. One of these being starting our day with a coffee around the kitchen table, it was here I decided to ask what British people actually meant when they said "you alright?', and what was the expected reply to their question. As you can imagine, my housemate had not considered that such a phrase could be confusing, it was part of his everyday vocabulary. He explained that in British English "you alright" is simply another way to say "hi", informal and nothing that required a detailed response of whether I was in fact alright or not, instead all I needed to respond was "you alright" back and the communicative transaction would be complete.
                                <br><br>
                                After my housemate explained that to me, my perception of the English language and how certain expressions relate to the culture of native speakers widened, and I realised that there was much more for me to learn of the English language to properly understand the people around me  and that the learning would never stop since the more cultures I explored the more I had to learn. I also came to the understanding that some parts of a different culture can only be learned by experiencing it, since it is the only way to appreciate the interactions and expressions that people take for granted and do not think are relevant enough to be explained in a school setting.
                                <br><br>
                                This encounter made me realise the way people interact with each other using language and specific expressions is much more complex and intricate than what I believed previously.  This realisation and my curiosity in better understanding this specific topic are the reasons behind me deciding to talk about it in this portfolio. I think that learning more about phatic expressions is going to be a fun experience that will result in a deepened understanding, not only of the subject, but also of the people around me.
