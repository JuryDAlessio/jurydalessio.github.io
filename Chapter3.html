                                The maturity of the web2.0 has created the need to find what the next step will be in the development of the internet. This has increased interest in the web3.0 which seems to be the next step in the creation of online communities and services. The reason for the interest in this new internet frontier are due to the new possibilities within the field of online service development and community interactions which promise to be an improvement to those that the web2.0 has provided us until now.
                                <br><br>
                                In essence, the difference between the web2.0 and the web3.0 appears to be how deeply the people interact with the web and how they interact online. The web2.0 indicates the first form of interaction between the users and the website, while the web3.0 refers to a more decentralised and secure infrastructure of the web2.0. The main selling point of web3.0 is the possibility of a more decentralised experience thanks to new technologies in development.
                                <br><br>
                                The web3.0 as of today is seen by many as just another of the buzzwords that are associated with this renewed interest in the field of web development and computer science as described by Z. Liu et al., (2021) “our perception of Web3.0 is still preliminary, obfuscated by a list of endless fancy words and terms”. While this might be the case for some of the proposed avenues of expansion, there is legitimate interest from many in a new chapter of the web. While for now web3.0 is still very much in its embryonic stage, and there is no guarantee that it will actually become something with actual everyday life applicability, it is interesting to analyse and evaluate the possible future impacts that this new suite of technology could have on our culture, society and our lives.
                                <br><br>
                                While the idea of a new and more private web has been part of the global scenario for some time, the recent rise in popularity of blockchain technologies, such as crypto currencies and non fungible tokens (NFT), has peaked the interest of multiple high profile figures in the web market towards the development of this new form of web interaction has spiked.<br>
                                The way in which this web3.0 is currently imagined contains interesting and underlying insights on how it could impact the current landscape of online communication and how we interact with the people around us through it.

                                We could be moving towards an online environment in which human interactions are increasingly commodified. The interest of people in the implementation of communities in the web3.0 is shown by the fact that, with blockchain technologies the entire experience can be moulded in an experience that can be used to generate profits.
                                <br><br>
                                This commodification of user interaction with the use of blockchain is already trying to find a spot in the web2.0, with the integration of NFT in online platforms such as Instagram and Twitter, but also in video games with a new mechanic called “Play to Earn”. This new mechanic allows people to interact with a video game and while generating limited collectibles in the form of NFT that can be held with the expectation of an increase in value in the future, like an investment, which can then be sold to make a profit. The most notable and controversial of this mechanic was the Ubisoft Quartz described by Ubisoft, (2021) as “a new platform for players to get Digits, the first NFTs playable in AAA games and running on energy-efficient technology. Each and every Digit is a high-quality asset and a unique, collectible piece of a Ubisoft world.” 
                                <br><br>
                                While the issue of commodification has been discussed for years as demonstrated by Prodnik (2012) in the analysis of Debord’s observations: “most of Debord’s observations look increasingly obvious in the fully developed postmodern society where human sociability, affects and communication as such are transformed into commodities and exchanged” - the way in which companies are approaching the development of web3.0 applications could exacerbate the issue.
                                <br><br>
                                The integration of “Interact to Earn” practices, if proven profitable, could one day be implemented by social media platforms commodifying online communications and interactions, trying to reward users for connecting with others and the platforms, disrupting the current status quo and possibly harming the experience of online communities.<br> 
                                The consequences of this would be a shift in the goal of internet communications similar to the one that occured within the arts, , used “as a means or instrument to attain goals in other than cultural areas” (Vestheim, 1994:65) with the disruption of current form of internet phatic communication reduced to tradable objects.
                                <br><br>
                                An example of this phenomena would be the commodification of memes as a form of NFT, this would cause the meme to lose its status as a form of internet phatic communication and it would impact the creation and use of new memes. The shift to a tradable collectible from a way to communicate would result in a change in attitude of meme creators and internet users that would see others as customers and interact in a way that would generate them the most profit. The community would therefore fail to appreciate the actual efficacy memes possess as a form of communication and reduce them to an investment alienating the community of existing and future internet users.
